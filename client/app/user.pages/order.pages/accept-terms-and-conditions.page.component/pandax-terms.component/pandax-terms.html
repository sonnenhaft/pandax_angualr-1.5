        Platform Connects Talent Service Providers and Clients</b></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The MNX Platform is a web-based communications platform
        which enables the connection between Clients and talent service providers
        (“Talent Service Provider”). “Clients” are individuals and/or businesses
        seeking to obtain entertainment services (“Entertainment Services”) from Talent
        Service Providers and are therefore clients of Talent Service Providers.  “Talent
        Service Providers” are individuals seeking to entertain Clients.  Talent
        Service Providers may serve drinks, converse with, and mingle with Clients,
        and/or perform exotic dances for purposes of Client entertainment.  Under no
        circumstances shall Talent Service Providers engage in any activity, perform
        any act, provide any service, or engage in any conduct in furtherance of any
        activity or service that is illegal under New York state or federal law.  Clients
        and Talent Service Providers together are hereinafter referred to as “Users.”
        If you agree on the terms of a particular Entertainment Service with another
        User, you and such other User form a Service Agreement directly between the two
        of you as set forth in more detail in Section 3 below.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>COMPANY DOES NOT PERFORM OR PROVIDE ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES
        AND DOES NOT EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS TO PERFORM ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES. COMPANY DOES
        NOT SUPERVISE, DIRECT OR CONTROL A TALENT SERVICE PROVIDERS ENTERTAINMENT
        SERVICE OR THE ENTERTAINMENT SERVICE IN ANY MANNER, WHICH CLIENT HEREBY
        ACKNOWLEDGES.  LIKEWISE</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The MNX Platform only enables connections between Users for
        the fulfillment of Entertainment Services provided by Talent Service Providers.
        Company is not responsible for the performance of Users, nor does it have
        control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other
        aspect whatsoever of the Entertainment Services, Talent Service Providers,
        Clients, or the integrity, responsibility, qualifications or any of the actions
        or omissions whatsoever of any Users. Company makes no representations about
        the suitability, reliability, or timeliness requested and the Entertainment Services
        provided by Users identified through the MNX Platform whether in public,
        private, or offline interactions.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The Company does not currently conduct criminal background
        checks on Clients and/or Talent Service Providers.  Users understand,
        acknowledge, and agree that the use of the MNX Platform is done at their own
        risk.  The Company reserves the right to conduct a criminal background check or
        other screenings (such as sex offender register searches), at any time and
        using available public records.  The Company further reserves the right to
        utilize third party services, where appropriate, to conduct investigations of
        any users.  Users hereby give consent to Company to conduct background checks
        as often as required in compliance with federal and state laws, including,
        without limitation, the Fair Credit Reporting Act. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The Company does not verify the statements of its users and
        the Company cannot confirm that each User is who they claim to be.  Therefore,
        Company cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or
        reliability of identity or background check information or any information
        provided through the MNX Platform.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>When interacting with other Users, you should exercise
        caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property, just as
        you would when interacting with other persons whom you don’t know.  You agree
        to take all necessary precautions in all interactions with Clients and/or
        Talent Service Providers you meet through the MNX Platform.  <span

    <p class=MsoNormal>You acknowledge and agree that a contract (the “Service
        Agreement”) is formed when you agree on the terms of Entertainment Services
        with another User. The terms of the Service Agreement include the terms set
        forth in this Section 3, the engagement terms proposed and accepted on the MNX
        Platform, and any other contractual terms accepted by both the Client and the Talent
        Service Provider to the extent such terms do not conflict with the terms in
        this Section 3 and do not expand Company’s obligations or restrict Company’s
        rights under this Agreement. You agree that Company is not a party to any
        Service Agreement and the formation of a Service Agreement will not, under any
        circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between
        Company and the Talent Service Provider.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The Client shall pay for the Entertainment Services through a
        third-party payment provider as indicated on the MNX Platform at the rates
        agreed to in the engagement terms. Both parties agree to notify Company of any
        disputes prior to negotiation of or filing of any claims and to negotiate any
        dispute informally via Company representatives for at least thirty (30) days
        before initiating any proceeding between the parties.</p>

        and Payment</b></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Users of the MNX Platform contract for Entertainment
        Services directly with other Users. Company will not be a party to any
        contracts for services. Payment for Entertainment Services through the MNX
        Platform is made via third-party payment provider Stripe, Inc.  Payment will be
        processed at the time of booking an Entertainment Service.  The Talent Service
        Provider is paid after the Entertainment Service is concluded.   </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Users of the MNX Platform will be required to provide a
        valid credit card or debit card to Company and/or the Payment Service Provider
        retained by Company (the “PSP”). Clients will be responsible for paying the
        invoice for each Entertainment Service (the “Invoice”), which will include (i)
        the pricing terms (“Payment”), (ii) any tip or gratuity, if applicable, (iii)
        the service charge Company assesses for the MNX Platform, variable based on the
        Payment amount;(iv) the platform fee, which is used to offset Company's cost;
        and (v) any applicable sales tax.  </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Payment processing services are provided by Stripe and are
        subject to the&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal">Stripe
            Connected Account Agreement</a>, which includes the&nbsp;<a
                href="https://stripe.com/legal">Stripe Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;(collectively,
        the “Stripe Services Agreement” or “PSP Agreement”). By agreeing to MNX Terms
        and Conditions of Service, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services
        Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a
        condition of MNX enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree
        to provide MNX accurate and complete information about you and you authorize MNX
        to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment
        processing services provided by Stripe.  By accepting these Terms and
        Conditions of Service, you agree that you have downloaded or printed, and
        reviewed and agreed to the PSP Agreement. Please note that Company is not a
        party to the PSP Agreement and that you, the PSP and any other parties listed
        in the PSP Agreement (currently, Stripe, Inc.) are the parties to the PSP
        Agreement and that Company has no obligations or liability under the PSP
        Agreement.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>When Client receives confirmation through the MNX Platform
        or via email that a Talent Service Provider has been engaged at the request of
        Client, Client automatically authorizes Company to provide Client's payment
        details to the PSP for processing of payment and the service charge and
        platform fees owed to Company for the use of the MNX Platform. You may be
        charged a cancellation fee through the PSP if you book any service provided by
        a Talent Service Provider, but cancel the order before it is completed.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but not
        the obligation), upon request from Client or Talent Service Provider or upon
        notice of any potential fraud, unauthorized charges or other misuse of the MNX
        Platform, to (i) place on hold any payment and out of pocket expenses, or (ii)
        refund, provide credits or arrange for the PSP to do so.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Users of the MNX Platform will be liable for any taxes
        (including VAT, if applicable) required to be paid on the services provided
        under the Agreement (other than taxes on Company’s income).</p>

        and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim between you and the
        Company related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and Company agree to first
        attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded
        below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any
        arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon
        written notice.  The Informal Resolution process may include mediation.  Your
        address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the
        email address you have provided to Company. Company’s address for such notices
        is MNX USA LLC, 745 5th Avenue, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10151.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal><b><u>BINDING ARBITRATION</u></b>. If you and Company are
        unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising
        from use of the MNX Platform (except those Disputes expressly excluded below)
        finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to
        arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND
        THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO
        SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and
        conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the
        American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s
        Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”),
        both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration
        fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA
        Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If your
        claim for damages does not exceed USD 5,000, Company will pay all such fees
        unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the
        relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for
        an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of
        Civil Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
        submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a
        decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless
        requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award
        may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise
        provided in this Agreement, you and Company may litigate in court to compel
        arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate
        or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A
        PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. You and Company agree that
        any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Company and you
        individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING
        THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
        ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Company
        otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s
        claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or
        representative proceeding.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL
        WAIVER. You may opt out of the foregoing arbitration and class action/jury
        trial waiver provision of this Agreement by notifying Company in writing within
        30 days of the date you first registered for the MNX Platform or 30 days from
        the date this Agreement was last updated. To opt out, you must send a written
        notification to Company at MNX USA LLC, 745 5th Avenue, 5th Floor, New York, NY
        10151, that includes (a) your account username, (b) your name, (c) your
        address, (d) your telephone number, (e) your email address, and (f) a clear
        statement indicating that you do not wish to resolve claims through arbitration
        and demonstrating compliance with the 30-day time limit to opt out of the above
        arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provisions.</p>
