Such informal negotiations will commence upon\\n        written notice.  The Informal Resolution process may include mediation.  Your\\n        address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the\\n        email address you have provided to Company.

If you and Company are\\n        unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising\\n        from use of the MNX Platform (except those Disputes expressly excluded below)\\n        finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to\\n        arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND\\n        THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO\\n        SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and\\n        conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the\\n        American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s\\n        Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”),\\n        both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration\\n        fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA\\n        Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If your\\n        claim for damages does not exceed USD 5,000, Company will pay all such fees\\n        unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the\\n        relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for\\n        an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of\\n        Civil Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the\\n        submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a\\n        decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless\\n        requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award\\n        may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise\\n        provided in this Agreement, you and Company may litigate in court to compel\\n        arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate\\n        or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>\\n\\n    <p class=MsoNormal>WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A\\n        PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING\\n        THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS\\n        ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Company\\n        otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s\\n        claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or\\n        representative proceeding.</p>\\n\\n    <p class=MsoNormal>RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL\\n        WAIVER.

To expedite resolution\\n        and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim between you and the\\n        Company related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and Company agree to first\\n        attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded\\n        below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any\\n        arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon\\n        written notice.  The Informal Resolution process may include mediation.  Your\\n        address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the\\n        email address you have provided to Company. Company’s address for such notices\\n        is MNX USA LLC, 745 5th Avenue, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10151.</p>\\n\\n    <p class=MsoNormal><b><u>BINDING ARBITRATION</u></b>. If you and Company are\\n        unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising\\n        from use of the MNX Platform (except those Disputes expressly excluded below)\\n        finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to\\n        arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND\\n        THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO\\n        SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and\\n        conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the\\n        American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s\\n        Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”),\\n        both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration\\n        fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA\\n        Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If your\\n        claim for damages does not exceed USD 5,000, Company will pay all such fees\\n        unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the\\n        relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for\\n        an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of\\n        Civil Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the\\n        submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a\\n        decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless\\n        requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award\\n        may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise\\n        provided in this Agreement, you and Company may litigate in court to compel\\n        arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate\\n        or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>\\n\\n    <p class=MsoNormal>WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A\\n        PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING\\n        THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS\\n        ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Company\\n        otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s\\n        claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or\\n        representative proceeding.</p>\\n\\n    <p class=MsoNormal>RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL\\n        WAIVER.
